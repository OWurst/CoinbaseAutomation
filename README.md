# CoinbaseAutomation
The end goal of this project is to set up automated crypto trading on coinbase, first step is to set up some methods for using the coinbase api and then do some research. I also want to set up a barrier between coinbase api and the app so that I can create a "test mode" which will allow me to save trades and holdings to a sqllite db to allow me to kind of paper trade prospective automation systems by mocking buys/sells/trades but still fetching currency data from the api.
